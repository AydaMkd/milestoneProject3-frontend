### Issues

#### Working as a team being in constant communication is key. We do run into a merge issues with our branches.
### What we learned:
- When working as a team, make sure to work in the latest version of the repository.
- git pull origin main it is a must, so you do not override the previous work of your team.
- Connecting the Front-End with Back-End.
