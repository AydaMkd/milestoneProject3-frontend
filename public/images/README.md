### Issues

#### Working as a team being in constant communication is key. We do run into a merge issues with our branches.
### What we learned:
- When working as a team, make sure to work in the latest version of the repository.
- git pull origin main it is a must, so you do not override the previous work of your team.
- Connecting the Front-End with Back-End.
- Some programs version number change so our code deprecated. The code superseded by newer code. Code was not inmediately removed because can cause a regression in the application. 
- 
### Work In Progress
- Calorie Counts
- Serving Conversion (MyCookbook.io)
- Add Difficulty Rating
- inventory of ingredients in pantry 
- link to grocery store shopping car for missing ingredients
